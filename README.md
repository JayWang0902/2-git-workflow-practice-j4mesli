## [Thousands of Software Engineers Say the Job Market Is Getting Much Worse](https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5y37j/thousands-of-software-engineers-say-the-job-market-is-getting-much-worse)

  I find [this article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5y37j/thousands-of-software-engineers-say-the-job-market-is-getting-much-worse) by VICE very interesting because it highlights a growing sense of insecurity among software engineers regarding their job prospects, a stark departure from the once perceived stability and abundance of opportunities in the tech industry. This shift is attributed to an industry-wide downturn and the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), which have intensified competition for available positions. A survey conducted by Motherboard and Blind involving 9,388 engineers reveals a significant sentiment that the job market has become more challenging post-pandemic, with a vast majority finding it harder to secure jobs compared to before. Furthermore, the narrative of Joe Forzano, an unemployed software engineer, exemplifies the difficulties faced by many in the field, as he recounts applying to over 250 jobs and undergoing numerous exhaustive interview processes without success, highlighting the competitive and unforgiving nature of the current job market.

  I believe that the impact of AI on the software engineering profession is a double-edged sword. On one hand, AI's capabilities in automating coding tasks have raised concerns about job security and the potential for reduced hiring in the tech sector. Despite these fears, a considerable portion of the engineers surveyed remains optimistic about their job security, with only a small fraction expressing concern over AI making their roles redundant. However, the anticipation that companies will likely hire fewer people due to AI advancements suggests a broader industry apprehension about the future of software engineering jobs. This evolving landscape underscores the need for professionals in the field to adapt to new technologies and potentially recalibrate their expectations regarding job stability and availability in the age of AI.

This topic is extremely relevant to me as someone who is quickly approaching the time to join the work force. The article really helped me realize the immediate negative effects of AI but I do think that AI is still very far from fully taking over software jobs.
